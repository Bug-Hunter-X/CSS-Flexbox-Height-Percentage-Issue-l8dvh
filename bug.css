The following CSS code snippet exhibits an unusual issue:  .box {width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: lightblue;}.container {width: 50%; height: 50%; background-color: lightcoral; display: flex;}.box {width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: lightblue;} The problem lies in the interaction between the percentage based widths and heights of the '.box' and '.container' classes coupled with the flexbox layout of the container.  The '.box' element does not occupy 100% of the container's height even though the height is set to 100%. This happens because flexbox items only take up as much space as they need unless explicitly told otherwise.
